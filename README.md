# panda_class

Materials for PANDA courses.  These classes can be self-guided or instructor guided.  Each contains a class "script" which is words, sentences, instructions, sample output etc.  Don't just execute the "cue" commands though! You will learn more if read all of what is written and understand what the commands you execute do.

Since class materials include qcows and PANDA replays which are bigger than the 100MB git file size limit, you will need to clone this repo using `lfs`.
That means you'll have to install lfs with

    git clone git-lfs

After which you will clone this repo with 

    git lfs clone ...

## Classes in this repo

`intro`: An introductory class of maybe 2-3 hours in which you try out a bunch of plugins (more prose here).  You should move the directory of `intro/panda_class_materials` to your home directory and then start following the class script in `panda_class_materials/docs/panda_class.md`
