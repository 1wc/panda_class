# panda_class

Materials for PANDA courses.  These classes can be self-guided or
instructor guided.  Each contains a class "script" which is words,
sentences, instructions, sample output etc.  Don't just execute the
"cue" commands though! You will learn more if read all of what is
written and understand what the commands you execute do.

*NOTE*: Class materials include qcows (virtual hard drives for
PANDA/qemu) and PANDA replays which are bigger than the 100MB git file
size limit. Thus, in order to get a working copy of these materials
you will need to clone this repo using `lfs`.  That means you'll have
to install lfs first with

    git clone git-lfs

After which you will clone this repo with the following incantation.

    git lfs clone ...

## Classes in this repo

`intro`: An introductory class of maybe 2-3 hours in which you try out
a bunch of plugins (more prose here).  You should move the directory
of `intro/panda_class_materials` to your home directory and then start
following the [class script](https://github.com/panda-re/panda_class/blob/master/intro/panda_class_materials/docs/panda_class.md).

`advanced`: An advanced version is planned that will involve
programming.
